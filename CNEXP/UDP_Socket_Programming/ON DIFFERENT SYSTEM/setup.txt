What you need to know:

Find the server's IP address:

Windows: Open Command Prompt → ipconfig → Look for "IPv4 Address"

Firewall Settings: Make sure port 12345 is allowed through the firewall

Windows: Windows Defender Firewall → Allow an app → Add port 12345 UDP

Both systems should be on the same network

Client Side (udp_client.py)
Change needed in line 4:
pythonserver_address = ('SERVER_IP_ADDRESS', 12345)
Replace 'localhost' with the actual IP address of the server machine.
Example:
pythonserver_address = ('192.168.1.100', 12345)  # Replace with your server's IP



Step-by-Step Setup:

On Server Machine:

Find its IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
Create file_to_send.txt in the same directory as the server script
Run: python udp_server.py


On Client Machine:

Update server_address with the server's IP
Run: python udp_client.py


Network Requirements:

Both machines must be on the same local network (same WiFi/LAN)
Or if on different networks, proper port forwarding and routing must be configured


Testing Checklist:
✓ Server IP address identified
✓ Client code updated with server IP
✓ Firewall allows port 12345 UDP
✓ Both machines on same network
✓ file_to_send.txt exists on server
✓ Run server first, then client
That's it! The only code change needed is updating the client's server_address with the actual server IP.
